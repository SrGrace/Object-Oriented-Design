# Online Book Reader
Design the data structures for an online book reader system.

## [Solution](https://github.com/SrGrace/Object-Oriented-Design/blob/master/Online%20Book%20Reader/OnlineBookReader.cpp)

To design a basic online reading system which provides the fllowing functionality:
* User membership creation and extension.
* Searching the database of books.
* Reading a book.
* Only one active user at a time
* Only one active book by this user.

To implement these operations we may require many other functions, like get, set, update, and so on. <br>
The objects required would likely include User, Book, and Library.

**Classes includes:**

```c++

class OnlineReaderSystem {}

class Library {}

class UserManager {}

class Display {}

class Book {}

class User {}

```
